## **Exercise 18: Sweeps with Guide Curves**  

This exercise involved creating a symmetrical bottle model using sweeps and advanced filleting.  

### **Key Steps**  
- **Symmetrical Bottle**: Used sweep tool with guide curves for smooth transitions.  
- **Variable Radius Fillets**: Applied curvature continuous fillets for tailored transitions.  
- **Pierce Relation**: Ensured sketches followed curves accurately.  
- **Split Lines**: Divided the bottle body for precise feature application.  
- **Configurations**: Created two profiles for the bottle using the configurations tab.  

### **Key Takeaways**  
- Advanced sweeps and filleting techniques enhance design integrity.  
- Proper dimensioning and relations ensure accurate geometry.
