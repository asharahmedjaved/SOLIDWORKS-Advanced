## **Exercise 26: Structural Steel and Weldments**  

This exercise focused on designing a structural steel frame using weldment tools.  

### **Key Steps**  
- **3D Sketching**: Defined the structureâ€™s layout using 3D sketches.  
- **Structural Members**: Added ANSI square tubes and grouped members to avoid trimming.  
- **Weld Beads**: Applied **Smart Weld** for accurate weld placement.  
- **Cut List**: Extracted a detailed cut list for fabrication.  

### **Key Takeaways**  
- Weldment tools automate structural designs and generate cut lists.  
- Proper grouping and corner treatments save time and improve accuracy.
