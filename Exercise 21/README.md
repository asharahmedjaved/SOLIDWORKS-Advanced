## **Exercise 21: Surfacing - Crafting a Spoon**  

This exercise involved creating a free-form spoon using advanced surfacing tools.  

### **Key Steps**  
- **Reference Sketches**: Inserted pixelated images and traced edges using **splines**.  
- **Surface Creation**:  
  - Used **Projected Curve** to create a 3D guide curve.  
  - Applied **Swept Surface** to generate the spoonâ€™s top surface.  
- **Final Touches**:  
  - Added **Loft Surface** for the bottom surface.  
  - Applied **fillets** for smooth transitions.  

### **Key Takeaways**  
- Surfacing tools are powerful for creating organic, complex shapes.  
- Proper use of guide curves and continuity options ensures precision.
