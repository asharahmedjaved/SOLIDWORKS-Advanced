## **Exercise 19: Mastering Sheet Metal Design**  

In this exercise, I created a functional enclosure for a system unit using advanced sheet metal tools.  

### **Key Steps**  
- **Top-Down Assembly Design**: Designed the enclosure directly within the assembly, "stealing" dimensions from the system unit for a perfect fit.  
- **Sheet Metal Tools**:  
  - Used **Base Flange** to set thickness and bend direction.  
  - Applied **Miter Flange** to create a side profile along the back edge.  
  - Added **teardrop hems** to eliminate sharp edges.  
- **Manufacturing Readiness**:  
  - Extracted a flat pattern for laser or water jet cutting.  
  - Created a detailed drawing and exported it as a DXF file.  
- **Press Brake Simulation**: Simulated bending stages with multiple configurations.  

### **Key Takeaways**  
- Efficient use of sheet metal tools ensures functional design and accurate manufacturing documentation.  
- Designing with manufacturability, safety, and precision in mind is crucial.
