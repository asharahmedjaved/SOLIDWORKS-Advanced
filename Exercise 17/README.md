## **Exercise 17: Equations for Adaptive Design**  

This exercise focused on using equations to control part dimensions and rib spacing.  

### **Key Steps**  
- **Basic Equations**: Started with a 2D sketch to understand equation functionality.  
- **Rib Structure Control**: Added equations to govern rib distance and number of copies.  
- **Linear Equations**: Implemented equations for rib spacing and quantity.  

### **Key Takeaways**  
- Equations ensure reliable, scalable designs but require careful parameter ranges.  
- Lab: Created a UPRINT tray, applying learned techniques.
