SOLIDWORKS Advanced Course - Project Repository

Welcome to my SOLIDWORKS Advanced Course repository! This repository contains all the project files, models, and documentation from my journey through the SOLIDWORKS Advanced Course. Each exercise represents a step forward in mastering advanced CAD design techniques, from 2D/3D translation and lofting to sheet metal, surfacing, and structural weldments.

About the Course
The SOLIDWORKS Advanced Course is an intensive program designed to deepen expertise in CAD design and engineering. Through hands-on exercises, I explored advanced tools and techniques, including:

2D and 3D Translation: Importing, exporting, and repairing files like IGES and STEP.

Advanced Lofting and Sweeping: Creating complex geometries with precision.

Mold Tools and Cast Parts: Designing parts with complex drafts, setback fillets, and draft analysis.

Design Tables and Equations: Automating design variations and parametric modeling.

Sheet Metal Design: Mastering cylindrical, conical, and lofted sheet metal parts.

Assembly Automation: Streamlining workflows with reusable design libraries and smart mates.

Surfacing: Designing free-form shapes using advanced surfacing tools.

Structural Weldments: Creating and optimizing structural steel frames with detailed cut lists.

This course has equipped me with the skills to tackle real-world engineering challenges with precision, efficiency, and creativity.

Repository Structure
The repository is organized by exercise, with each folder containing the relevant SOLIDWORKS part files, assemblies, drawings, and documentation.
