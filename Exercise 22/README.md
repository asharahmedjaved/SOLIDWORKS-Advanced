## **Exercise 22: IGES Repair and File Translation**  

This exercise focused on repairing IGES files and handling 3D neutral file formats.  

### **Key Steps**  
- **Import Diagnostics**: Identified and closed small gaps automatically.  
- **Filled Surface**: Patched larger gaps with appropriate continuity options.  
- **File Translation**: Saved the repaired model as a **Parasolid Binary** file.  

### **Key Takeaways**  
- IGES files often require repair for proper use in SOLIDWORKS.  
- Understanding continuity options (tangency vs. curvature) is crucial.
