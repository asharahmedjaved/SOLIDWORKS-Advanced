## **Exercises 24 & 25: Conical Parts and Sheet Metal Lofts**  

These exercises compared traditional and modern methods for modeling conical sheet metal parts.  

### **Key Steps**  
- **Conical Parts**:  
  - Used **Boss Extrude** with draft and **Shell** to create a hollow cone.  
- **Sheet Metal Lofts**:  
  - Created lofted sheet metal parts using **Dynamic Mirroring** and **Sheet Metal Loft**.  

### **Key Takeaways**  
- Lofted sheet metal is ideal for complex geometries.  
- Traditional methods are simpler but less flexible.
