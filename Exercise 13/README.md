## **Exercise 13: Bottle Model with Loft, Cut Sweep, Thread, and Shell Features**  

In this exercise, I created a bottle model using advanced SOLIDWORKS features.  

### **Key Steps**  
- **Loft Feature**: Used guide curves in independent sketches for precise control.  
- **Fillet**: Applied a Curvature Continuous Fillet for smoother transitions, checked using zebra stripes.  
- **Cut Sweep**: Used split lines and an ellipse for the handle to maintain a watertight boundary.  
- **Threading**: Created threads using the Helix feature.  
- **Visualization**: Enhanced rendering with sunlight settings, sky, and lighting adjustments.
