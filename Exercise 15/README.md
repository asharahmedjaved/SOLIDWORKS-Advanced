## **Exercise 15: Mold Cavity Design**  

I designed a mold cavity and core using traditional methods.  

### **Key Steps**  
- **Assembly & Base Creation**: Created an assembly and enveloped the original part for cavity creation.  
- **Scaling**: Adjusted for material shrinkage using feature scale and cavity options.  
- **Core Development**: Used convert entities and extrusion to form the core.  
- **Drawing & Documentation**: Created detailed drawings with legacy sectioning and custom layers.  

### **Key Takeaways**  
- Proper scaling is crucial for material shrinkage.  
- Integrated cavity-core workflows improve accuracy.  
- Enhanced documentation communicates design intent effectively.
